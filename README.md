## HW2: Blackjack Assignment

### Goal

The goal of this game is to draw a hand (of cards) that is higher than the dealer's and is not greater than 21.

### Game Buttons
#### MainMenu
*?* brings up the rules of Blackjack.

*Choose Card* allows you to change the color of the card design.

*Start Game* starts the actual game of Blackjack. Once you start, there is no going back.

#### GameBoard
*Deal* starts the round by shuffling the deck and distributing 2 cards to the player and the dealer. 

*Hit* allows the player to draw another card.

*Stand* indicates that the player is done with their turn and the dealer should make their move.

Move your mouse around the screen to *aim* the ship and click the mouse to *shoot*.

### Additional Features 
#### *(included outside of minimum required elements)*

I added functionality that allowed the player to shoot pill bullets at the germs. When a bullet hits a germ the bullet is deleted and the germ spawns two smaller, discolored germs. If these smaller germs are hit they will delete without spawning new germs.

In addition to the added shooting functionality I drew up custom sprites for the game so as to make it more aesthetically interesting!

Lastly, I attempted to play with the animation object in unity in hopes of animating my sprites, but I wasn't able to figure out how to implement it successfully.
