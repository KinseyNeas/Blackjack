## HW2: Blackjack Assignment

### Goal

The goal of this game is to draw a hand (of cards) that is higher than the dealer's and is not greater than 21.

### Game Buttons
#### MainMenu
*(?)* brings up the rules of Blackjack.

*(Choose Card)* allows you to change the color of the card design.

*(Start Game)* starts the actual game of Blackjack. Once you start, there is no going back.

#### GameBoard
*(Deal)* starts the round by shuffling the deck and distributing 2 cards to the player and the dealer. 

*(Hit)* allows the player to draw another card.

*(Stand)* indicates that the player is done with their turn and the dealer should make their move.

### Additional Features 
#### *(included outside of minimum required elements)*

I added background audio to the game and audio to button clicks.

I added dynamic card color changing, which can be seen in the Main Menu. When you click the card design you want, the card design changes on the screen. Also in the Main Menu I dynamically generate card positions for the background cards.

Within my card flipping animation, I utilized Animation Events so that the animation would change based on card design.

Lastly, I attempted to add a card dealing animation but the animation was messing up my card positions so I changed it back to normal.
